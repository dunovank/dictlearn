Working with VTK
================


The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open-source, freely available software system for
3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. It consists of a C++ class
library and several interpreted interface layers including Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python.
VTK supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor,
texture, and volumetric methods, as well as advanced modeling techniques such as
implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay
triangulation. VTK has an extensive information visualization framework and a suite of
3D interaction widgets. The toolkit supports parallel processing and integrates with
various databases on GUI toolkits such as Qt and Tk. VTK is cross-platform and runs on
Linux, Windows, Mac, and Unix platforms. VTK is part of Kitwareâ€™s collection of
commercially supported open-source platforms for software development.


Installing
----------


VTK version 8.0.0 and later is available on PyPi for python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6

.. code-block:: none

    $ pip install vtk


On Windows only python 3.5 and 3.6 are supported. VTK can also be installed with
anaconda. Available versions are at https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/vtk/files.


If you want to build VTK yourself, download it from https://www.vtk.org.
When building toggle the flag `VTK_WRAP_PYTHON` to generate the wrapping files.
Detailed instructions can bee seen

Wrappers
""""""""

Reading and writing VTK image files to and from numpy array requires a lot of
boilerplate code. The classes below, :code:`VTKImage` and :code:`VTKInformation` wraps
reading and writing :code:`vti` files, ie images of type :code:`vtkImageData`. To read an
image, write: :code:`image = VTKImage.read('path.vti')`. If :code:`image` will be modified
you have to save its attributes: :code:`info = image.information()`.

:code:`VTKImage` is a subclass of :code:`numpy.ndarray` and can be used as any normal numpy array.

Finally the image can be written to disk

.. code-block:: python

    VTKImage.write_vti('new_path.vti', image, info)

.. py:class:: VTKImage

    Numpy ndarray wrapper for VTK images. This class holds meta data 
    about the image such that reading and writing to file will keep 
    the correct attributes
        
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import dictlearn as dl
    >>> # volume is a numpy array
    >>> volume = VTKImage.read('path/to/volume.vti')  
    >>> assert isinstance(volume, np.ndarray)
    >>> prod = np.dot(volume[:10, :10], np.random.rand(10, 5))
    >>> assert prod.shape == (10, 5)
    >>> patches = dl.Patches(volume)
    >>> patch_generator = patches.create_batch_and_reconstruct(10000):
    >>> for batch, reconstruct in patch_generator:
    >>>     # Handle batch
    >>>     reconstruct(batch)
        
    Write 'patches.reconstructed' to disk with the
    same attributes as 'path/to/volume.vti'
        
    >>> volume.write('path/to/volume_new.vti', patches.volume)

    .. py:method:: write(self, path, array=None)

        Write data (array or self) to 'vti' file. This file is written with
        self.extent, self.origin, self.spacing and self.dtype. 
        If the instance is created with VTKImage.read() these attributes 
        are copied from the read file, otherwise the default values are used:
        
            * extent = [0, self.dimensions[0] - 1,
                        0, self.dimensions[1] - 1,
